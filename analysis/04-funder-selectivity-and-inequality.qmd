Research questions:
- What is the effect of a funding agencyâ€™s level of selectivity on the uptake of data sharing among research teams which allocate their resources strategically?
- What is the effect of the introduced policy on inequality of resources within the system?


Approach:

1. Reproduce the below analysis from individual data
2. Run across all three types of networks
3. Analyse inequality/how takes up sharing with lagged regression or similar
