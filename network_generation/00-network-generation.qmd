# Rationale

We aim to assess network effects by embedding the teams in our simulation into
different kinds of networks. This is intended to reduce the number of
abstractions that the model entails, thus making the model slightly more
"realistic", in that actual researchers are of course embedded into a network of
social ties, and these ties have an effect on the researchers themselves.

As a baseline, we consider a random network.
